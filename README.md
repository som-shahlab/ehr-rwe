# Medical Device Surveillance with EHRs

Weak supervision methods for extracting patient outcomes from clinical EHR text.

**NOTE**: Our original code was written in [Snorkel v0.7](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-extraction) and parts of [Snorkel MeTaL]() which are now depricated. We've ported a simple, example pipeline for use in the latest release of [Snorkel v0.9.1](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel)
