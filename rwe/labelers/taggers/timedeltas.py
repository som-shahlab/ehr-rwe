class TimeDeltaTagger(Tagger):
    """
    Link spans to their nearest (in token distance) normalized date mention.
    For example:

    INPUTS: DOCTIME:  12/15/2017
            SPAN:     hip implant
            SENTENCE: On 11/13/2017, the patient came into the clinic with an
                      infected hip implant.
    OUTPUT: (hip implant, -32 days)

    CAVEATS:
    - We restrict to datetime mentions found in the same sentence as our
      target span.
    - We ignore spans that occur within HEADER mentions
    - Relying on only the nearest DATETIME mention fails in many cases.
      Consider the examples:

        + Chief Complaint: 60 year old white female s/p CABG 2016-01-05 with
          fever and sternal wound drainage.

      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was done on 2016-01-05,
      but 'fever' and 'sternal wound drainage' are current conditions.

        + Since the previous tracing of 2015-03-17 sinus bradycardia
          rate is slower.

      Current slower sinus bradycardia is being compared to a previous tracing
      on 2015-03-17.

    TODOs:
    - This should be a proper classification task where we predict links
     between spans and TIMEX3's.
    - Create interface for ranked list (by token distance) of all datetimes
      given a span to allow for more flexible LF design.
